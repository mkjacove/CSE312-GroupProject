IMPORTANT ATTRIBUTION NOTE:
Practically all of the front end of this project was either taken from Zaid's front end styling used in the homeworks, or was generated by chatgpt. For the front end taken from Zaid, we have received permission from him to take whatever we need. 

However, we do realize we may have taken too much of Zaid's front end when implementing the change avatar page. We definitely plan to change that for the final submission.
